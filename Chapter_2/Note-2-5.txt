                                  2.5 Content Model Categories
											 
Containership rules:- eg. the head container must contain a title element,and a p container must not contain a div container.
 With lots of elements (around 115), there are lots of containership rules (more than 11,000).
 
It is easier to assign elements to certain categories and have those categories be the basis for the containership rules.

One or more elements of metadata content, of which exactly one is a title element and no more
 than one is a base element.
 
p container is allowed to include elements that are in the phrasing category.

If two categories overlap, that means that the categories include some elements that are in
both categories.

If a category is completely inside another category, then all the enclosed category’s elements are also in the
 surrounding category.
                         
								Content Model Category Descriptions
The metadata category includes elements that provide information associated with the web page as a whole	.
     It includes all the elements that are allowed in the head container.
The flow category includes plain text and all the elements that are allowed in a web page body
container.

The blockquote, div, hr, p, and pre elements are flow content elements,and they are not in any other 
 content model categories.
 
The script element is for JavaScript.It’s in the flow content category as well as the metadata content category 
 (note the intersection of those two categories in the content model categories diagram).
