                                        2.6 Block Elements
													 
A block element expands to fill the width of its container, so for a given container, there will be only one 
 block element for each row in the container.
 
Different from a phrasing element in that:
    1.a phrasing element’s width matches the width of the element’s contents 
	 2.multiple phrasing elements can display in one row.
