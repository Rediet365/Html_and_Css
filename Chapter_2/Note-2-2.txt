                          HTML Coding Conventions
								  
	If a web page’s code uses improper syntax or improper style, web browsers won’t display an error
	message; instead, they’ll try to render the code in a reasonable manner.This will depend on browsers.
	Program maintenance means debugging and enhancing a program after it has been released initially.
			  It is important to remember the following style rules:
				-For every container element, include both a start tag and an end tag. So even though it’s
				  legal to omit a p element’s end tag, we don't do it.
				-Use lowercase for all tag names (e.g., meta) and attributes (e.g., name).
				-Use lowercase for attribute values unless there’s a reason for uppercase. 
				  For a meta author element, use title case for the author’s name because that’s 
				  how people’s names are normally spelled (e.g., name="Dan Connolly").
				-For attribute-value assignments, surround the value with quotes, and omit spaces around
				  the equals sign.
