                      blockquote Element
							 
	It is another block element.
	We should use a blockquote element when We have a quotation that is too 
	 long to embed within surrounding text.
	It’s a block element, so it spans the width of its container.
	Its content spans the width of the nonmargin part of its enclosing container.

					  Typical Default Display Properties

					  From  Figure 2.3’s code:

	The first CSS rule says to use a block value for the display property. That means that the element the
	 rule applies to, blockquote in this case, will span the width of its container.
	The second and third CSS rules apply to the top and bottom margins. 
	The fourth and fifth CSS rules apply to the left and right margins.

							 cite Attribute

			 <blockquote cite="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=15545">
	The purpose of the cite attribute is to document where the quote can be found on the Internet. 
	The purpose of the cite attribute is to document where the quote can be found on the Internet. 
	The cite attribute’s value must be in the form of a URL. Browsers do not display the cite attribute’s value. 
	 That’s because the URL value is not for end users. Instead, it serves as documentation for the web developer(s) 
	  in charge of maintaining the web page.
	Another benefit of including the cite attribute is that it can be used as a “hook” for adding functionality 
	 to the blockquote element.

								Block Formatting

	For a blockquote element with enclosed text that’s greater than one line,we should use block formatting.
	Block formatting is a coding-style convention where the start and end tags go on their
	 own lines and the enclosed text is indented

	A “file” protocol means the web page was generated by simply double clicking on its .html file from within
