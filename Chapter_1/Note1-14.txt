                     1.14 How to Check Your HTML Code
							
After we think we are finished creating or modifying a web page we should check our work by running the W3C's 
HTML Validation Service(Konown as MArkup Validation Service).
 There are 3 options to check:-
	In the first option Validate URL the user enters a web address for the page that is to be checked.
	With the second option, Validate by File Upload, the user selects a file on his or her local computer.
	With the third option, Validate by Direct Input, the user copies HTML code directly into a large text box.
