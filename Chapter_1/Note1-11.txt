									  1.11History of HTML

	In 1989, to help with collaborative research at CERN (the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland), 
	Tim Berners-Lee came up with the idea of adding “hypertext links”to research papers, so when one paper referred to another, 
	the reader could click the link and quickly go to the other paper.

	 From 1989–1991 :-  (1) He designed HTML, with hypertext links as the key feature
							  (2) he designed the concepts behind the World Wide Web, including 
									 the HTTP protocol
							  (3) he created a prototype browser for surfing the Internet with HTML 
									web pages
	 In 1993 :- Tim Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly submitted the first formal proposal for HTML 
					 to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
	In 1994:- Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute 
	of Technology,with the W3C taking over the stewardship of the HTML standard.
	In 2000 :- XHTML1.0 introduced with syntax rules.
				  Its Strict enforced XML rules such as:-
					  (1) requiring quoted values for all attributes.
					  (2) requiring a / for all void elements
					  (3) requiring an end tag for every container element.

	In 2001:- The W3C remedied this browser leniency problem by developing and approving a
				 harsher standard, XHTML 1.1, which specified a new “fail on first error” system.
